      <h1>Roydan Design System</h1>
      <h2>A design system is only as useful as its integration with your teamâ€™s design and development practices. As a small company's first product designer, I iteratively constructed an entire design pipeline. </h2>
      <img src="../img/d1.png"></img>
      
      <h1>Problem Discovery</h1>
      <p>Roydan had been developing features for their loyal customers for 40 years. The team had never hired a dedicated designer and did not have any design processes in place. They knew that their sprawling product suite was ready for a design overhaul as they looked towards entering new markets.  </p>
      <img src="../img/d2.png"></img>
      <p>As I became familiar with the complexity of the company, their business and their users, I came to view the implementation of a design process and system as a product. Its users would be our future design team, our developers and our customer success team.  </p>
      
      <h1>Organizational Design </h1>
      <p>Before I could start making any designs, I knew I needed to implement a design process that integrated with the company's long-standing development practices. The team was already well acquainted with agile methodology. We held a standup every morning, held retrospectives after every two-week sprint, and kept track of our work using kanban boards.  </p>
      <img src="../img/d3.png"></img>
      <p>The design process I implemented entailed a weekly cycle which could optionally be extended to biweekly if the design team was tackling more complex design tickets. We would begin by prioritizing design problems and identifying the technical scope of potential solutions with input from the dev team. The middle of our cycle was dedicated to drafting our new solutions and conducting regular user research alongside the customer success team. Our cycle would conclude with presenting our designs to the customer success team for feedback. We would either rethink aspects of our designs for the next cycle, or add comprehensive documentation, to prepare solutions for developer handoff. </p>
      <img src="../img/d4.png"></img>
      <p>The company was small and employee-owned, with all employees acting as important stakeholders. I put special effort into presenting the rationale for proposed process changes to the whole team and sought consensus at each iterative step. </p>
      
      <h1>A Modular Design System </h1>
      <p>I constructed a design system in Figma to supplement the new design process. The system allowed the design team to focus their time on solving new design problems rather than recreating components and patterns that had been used before. </p>
      <img src="../img/d5.png"></img>
      <p>The design system had a modular structure based on a third-party React-based component library that I selected for its alignment with our product's requirements. I used the Atomic Design methodology. Base components from the library, modified with a custom theme, were organized and labeled according with their use cases and links to further documentation.  </p>
      <img src="../img/d6.png"></img>
      <p>These were combined into reusable composite components, which were in turn combined into major elements of a page, which were finally combined into full-screen design patterns. All designer would need to do is choose a pattern, then choose which components would be used in that pattern, all according to provided guidelines. This meant that design work could always be reused and adapted in a consistent way to fit into a new context. </p>
      
      <h1>Design System Workflow </h1>
      <p>Through trial and error, we found that the ideal structure for this design system was to mirror our development workflow. At the top of the Figma file structure were pages guiding new team members how to navigate and use it while developing. Next, we had libraries of reuseable components with valuable documentation for developers and designers. </p>
      <img src="../img/d7.png"></img>
      <p>Below these permanent pages, we had dozens of pages each corresponding to a different design ticket in our kanban board, which contained the user story and acceptance criteria for a feature. These pages moved from one category to the next in our design system as they progressed through the design process. When the tickets were costed and handed off to the development team, the corresponding pages in the design system were found in a dedicated category with all the documentation needed to build the feature. The design pages were labeled with their connected ticket number. In turn, the tickets in the kanban board linked to their corresponding page in the design system for easy reference. </p>
      <img src="../img/d8.png"></img>
      <p>We our team began focusing entirely on our new product launch, our team had grown a lot. We had hired a junior designer to join the UX team. We also integrated with a third party development studio. Everyone in and outside of our company made extensive use of our design system to track a vast number of features as they were passed around between teams during our hectic development sprints. </p>
      
      <h1>Outcome</h1>
      <p>Our team was able to integrate for the first time with a third-party development studio by relying on the design system documentation as a source of truth. We took more than 100 features from design to deployment in 6 months. We launched our MVP, built entirely using reusable components documented in our design system, to an alpha group of 12 enterprise customers. </p>
