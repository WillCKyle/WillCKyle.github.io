      <h1>Roydan Design System</h1>
      <p>A design system is only as useful as its integration with your teamâ€™s design and development practices. As a small company's first product designer, I iteratively constructed an entire design pipeline. </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d1.png"></img>
      </figure>
      
      <h1>Problem Discovery</h1>
      <p>Roydan had been developing features for their loyal customers for 40 years. The team had never hired a dedicated designer and did not have any design processes in place. They knew that their sprawling product suite was ready for a design overhaul as they looked towards entering new markets.  </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/d2.png"></img>
        <figcaption>A single user's experience of our services in a typical workflow was divided among multiple front-end frameworks and third-party platforms.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As I became familiar with the complexity of the company, their business and their users, I came to view the implementation of a design process and system as a product. Its users would be our future design team, our developers and our customer success team.  </p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h1>Organizational Design </h1>
      <p>Before I could start making any designs, I knew I needed to implement a design process that integrated with the company's long-standing development practices. The team was already well acquainted with agile methodology. We held a standup every morning, held retrospectives after every two-week sprint, and kept track of our work using kanban boards. Our new design process mirrored this structure by following a one-week cycle which could optionally be extended to two weeks when tackling more complex design features. We tracked each design feature in a dedicated kanban board.</p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d3.png"></img>
      <figcaption>Design tickets in our kanban board progressed through columns corresponding to stages of the design process.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Our design cycle would begin by prioritizing design problems and identifying the technical scope of potential solutions with input from the dev team. The middle of our cycle was dedicated to drafting our new solutions and conducting regular user research alongside the customer success team. Our cycle would conclude with presenting our designs to the customer success team for feedback. We would either rethink aspects of our designs for the next cycle, or add comprehensive documentation, to prepare solutions for developer handoff. </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d4.png"></img>
      <figcaption>Complete design tickets contained screenshots and a link to annotated designs in Figma.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The company was small and employee-owned, with all employees acting as important stakeholders. I put special effort into presenting the rationale for proposed process changes to the whole company and sought consensus at each iterative step. </p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h1>A Modular Design System </h1>
      <p>I constructed a design system in Figma to supplement the new design process. The system allowed the design team to focus their time on solving new design problems rather than recreating components and patterns that had been used before. </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d5.png"></img>
      <figcaption>"Atom" components were combined into "molecules" with more specific use cases.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The design system had a modular structure based around a third-party React component library that I selected for its alignment with our product's requirements. Base components from the library, modified with a custom theme, were organized and labeled according with their use cases and links to further documentation. The design system was organized according to Atomic Methodology, with new complex components built from these base component "atoms".</p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d6.png"></img>
      <figcaption>Composite components were built to be quickly reuseable across many different contexts.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These components were combined into reusable collections of components, which were in turn combined into major areas of a page, which were finally combined into full-screen design patterns. All designer would need to do is choose a pattern, then choose which components would be used in that pattern, all according to provided guidelines. This ensured that design work could always be reused and adapted in a consistent way to fit into a new context. </p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h1>Design System Workflow </h1>
      <p>Through trial and error, we found that the ideal structure for this design system was to mirror our development workflow. At the top of the Figma file structure were pages guiding new team members how to navigate and use it during development. Further down, we had libraries of reuseable components with valuable documentation for developers and designers. </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d7.png"></img>
      <figcaption>An introductory guide for anyone in the organization to learn how to browse the design system.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Below these permanent pages, we had dozens of pages each corresponding to a different design ticket in our kanban board. Each ticket's user story and acceptance criteria was reflected by annotations in the design system. These design pages moved from one category to the next in our design system as they progressed through the design process. When the tickets were costed and handed off to the development team, the corresponding pages in the design system were found in a dedicated build category with all the documentation needed. </p>
      <p>The design pages were labeled with their connected ticket number. In turn, the tickets in the kanban board linked to their corresponding page in the design system for easy reference. </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../img/d8.png"></img>
      <figcaption>An example design ticket in our kanban board with a user story, acceptance criteria, and a Figma link.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>By the time we began focusing entirely on the new product launch, our team had grown significantly. We had hired a junior designer who, with me as Design Lead, formed the beginning of our design team. We also integrated with a third party development studio. Everyone in and outside of our company made extensive use of our design system to track a vast number of features as they were passed around between teams during our hectic development sprints. </p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h1>Outcome</h1>
      <p>Our team was able to integrate for the first time with a third-party development studio by relying on the design system documentation as a source of truth. We took more than 100 features from design to deployment in half a year. We launched our MVP, built entirely using reusable components documented in our design system, to an alpha group of a dozen enterprise customers. </p>
