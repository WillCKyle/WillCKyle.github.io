      Odomo is an early-stage project building a consumer app leveraging web3 values and technology. Its core value proposition is connecting and transforming real-world communities.

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      I spoke with community leaders trying to strategize a social movement, artists trying to establish a local scene and entrepreneurs trying to collaborate with other enterprises. They all lack a way to build actionable consensus among diverse stakeholders to achieve collective goals.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      A long period of research and development yielded a new system of consensus building which was actionable and scalable. I designed a consumer app centered around events to deliver this value and provide a viral growth strategy. The final product was a polished preview website which attracted valuable teammates and collaborators.    
    </p>
      
    <h2>Results after release of the preview site:</h2>

    <div class="flex">
      <div style="width: 50%">
        <h1>3</h1>
        <p>Startup founders joined as advisors
        </p>
        
      </div>
      <div style="width: 50%">
        <h1>6</h1>
        <p>Technical collaborators joined the team
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    

    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>The consensus model I set out to either find or design had a number of key user requirements drawn from extensive early user interviews: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The model needed to synthesize knowledge between stakeholders, not just identify the popularity of positions. </li>
      <li>The model needed to have unlimited scalability, so that every person can meaningfully contribute to the outcome regardless of how many people participate. </li>
      <li>The model needed to be decentralized enough to work without relying on privileged and biased moderators. </li>
      <li>The model needed to minimize new rules and terms to be easily learned by users. </li>
      <li>The consensus produced by the model needed to be detailed and actionable.  </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Throughout the course of research, I settled into a looping three-part design process. This was repeated dozens of times due to the complexity of the feature. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ideate: Cast a broad net of competitor analysis, exploring collective decision-making practices from governments, social movements and digital technology across all time periods and geography.  </li>
      <li>Implement: Consolidate findings to find generalized insights, identify promising features, and develop a new design iteration of a complete consensus-building model. </li>
      <li>Test: Conduct usability research to identify as many flaws in the model iteration as possible. The goal here is to generate questions to guide a new round of competitor analysis.   </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Art Direction and Branding </h2>
    <p>Odomo's design direction is coordinated with its product strategy. Across the platform, navigation UI has been minimized to emphasize events and consensus as immersive content. Content is generally presented in two columns, maximizing the user's agency to select content relevant to their interest. </p>
    <p>The primary color palette is presented as an opalescent graphic centered on pale blue. This gives an impression of serenity, dynamism and sensuality to emphasize the app's connection between intellectual clarity and embodied engagement with the real world. The secondary color pallet is grayscale in either dark or light mode, helping to emphasize the color pallet of content first. </p>
    <p>The brand icon is designed to emphasize the core value proposition of consensus-building. The shape draws from the yin yang symbol, which represents the unity of opposites and their dynamic development over time. Both sides of the Odomo icon, representing two perspectives, are unified by their shared primary graphic fill. </p>
    <p>The tone of branded communications emphasizes clarity, pragmatism and innovation. In line with this theme is the name, which is not based on any existing words. The name is designed to be memorable, with a succinct three syllables utilizing sounds that are learned in early childhood across many languages.  </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This product was designed within numerous constraints, primarily being that the bulk of the work was led by a single person working with a single advisor. The project had neither an existing user base nor a budget to conduct user research. Yet within these bounds, I implemented a robust end-to-end product design process using industry best practices.</p>
    <p>The end product in this case was not a developed app, but rather a fleshed out prototype that has been used to acquire talent who are committed to the product vision. In this respect, the product has been an overwhelming success.</p>
    <p>Even without significant outreach and publicity, the product has drawn interest for ongoing communication and high-level collaboration from four startup founders in the industry. It has also attracted six collaborators with a mix of skills including a majority specializing in back-end development. The team is growing and ready to enter active development.</p>
